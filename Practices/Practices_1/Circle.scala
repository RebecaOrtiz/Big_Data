//Develop a scala algorithm that calculates the radius of a circuit

//Import the scala.math library, it contains methods to perform basic numerical operations as elementary functions
import scala.math

//We need the circumference of the circle
var circuferencia= 15

//Pi is multiplied by 2
var pi=6.28

//Radius formula = circumference / (2pi 0 6.28)
var radio= (circuferencia / 6.28)
println(circuferencia)

//The result is 
//radio: Double = 2.3885350318471334
