                                     PAIR CODING

Pair Programming consists of 2 developers simultaneously working on programming a functionality.
The ingredients in this recipe are:
2 people.
1 screen.
1 computer.
1 keyboard.
1 mouse or trackpad.
 
The key is that during the session the 2 people are exchanging the role of writing code. One stings and the other looks...

Benefits
1. Quality 
The quality born in this methodology is by:
4 eyes see better than 2.
2 people together think better than 1 and usually get to better solutions.
 
2. Handover of knowledge
Both technical and functional. Knowledge silos are avoided: that only 1 person is responsible for a specific part of the project.
 
3. Skill transfer
There's always something to learn from the other person, IDE tricks, code style, new ways to tackle a problem...
 
4. Resilience
Pair Programming is an intensive methodology, there are no moments for chats or a quick check to Instagram, you have the other person stinging for you or pending you, now, the constant rotation of the type of task gives air to our mind and have the wildcard of the call (to which it does not bite) right next to it can take you out of a block and win Attention... Speed!!! 
 
Risk (or fear)
It increases the cost of using this methodology. Now, no, it's not twice as good (if it comes out twice as much is that it's getting bad).
This fear comes from a culture that believes that the programmer writes lines of code, if he writes more code in less time is more productive, therefore 2 programmers writing a single code write half as much as 2 and are therefore less productive...
What's the point of writing code twice as fast (2 people) if you advance less because the number of errors, per person is multiplied, precisely by 2? (exaggerating at the level at which I think 2 programmers produce twice the functionality of 1) And I'm not counting the time of the third person who finds the error and then has to revalidate it.
What is the cost of lower quality? Go back on the same code over and over again to resolve bugs.
 
What is the benefit of faster learning? Not only technical but also functional.
 
What price do we pay for not sharing enough knowledge? When the on-call expert changes project or gives a twist to his professional career and leaves a team or project in a more than compromised situation.
